change AREF to 4v using a TL431
using a 2K resistor and a 3.3K resistor
>>> 2.4880/33*53
3.9958787878787874t

lift the ground legs of the TC op-amps,
connect a red LED and capacitor from it to ground,
and a 100ohm resistor from that leg to the minus of MAX232
0.22uF caps at each op-amp leg to ground, and a 10uF tantalum

remove R389-R396 or whatever pulls inv.inputs to ground

install 0.1ohm resistors (300mA = 0.03V => 3.0V ADC)
across inputs of thermocouple ports for solar currents

connect - of thermocouple ports to drains of mosfets

attach eight-pin header (on prototyping area) to grounds
and to ADC ports

connect + of thermocouple ports to eight-pin header anodes

apogee pyranometer = 0.20 mV per W m-2 or 0.20 Volts @ 1000Wm^2
change the two 100K resistors R353,R354 to 10K for TC11 port
so that 1000Wm^2 = 2.0 volts at ADC
